 Greetings, everyone. I'm Dr. Beth Foster, Director of the School of Advertising and Public Relations. I wanted to take a moment to welcome you as you embark on an exciting academic journey learning about advertising or public relations. Whether you're a current major in our school, a different major, or undecided, one of the exciting things about these courses is that they expose you to skills you will use in any career. We have courses in research, design, writing, and campaigns offering you hands-on training and smaller class settings. One thing you will hear your professors talk about the most is the importance of internships. Knoxville has thriving advertising and public relations industries. There are often more internships available than we have students, so we will help you get that critical experience. Also, you can get class credit for internships. We have two fantastic student professional organizations, ad club, and the Public Relations Student Society of America. Please get involved and consider serving in a leadership role. You don't have to be an advertising or public relations major to join either organization. You will get important networking opportunities with professionals while connecting with other students and learning more about the fields. Also, another thing that makes our majors unique is the close relationships our professors develop with their students. Our majors do not feel like a number. Even our alumni go above and beyond to connect with and mentor our students. So, welcome again to your introductory class and advertising or public relations. Do not hesitate to contact me if you have questions or would like more information. I look forward to meeting you.
