00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 There's so many friends, I've never had a baby like you, I've never signed up for them.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I'm Kroos Pedrone and I'm part of the graduating advertising class of the best year ever 2020.

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Currently I'm living it up in Nashville. I work at this really really cool agency called GSNF.

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 I am an account executive in the interactive department which is basically me being a project manager with a bunch of web developers, app developers, all that stuff.

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 And I get the absolute pleasure of doing sometimes what we call a smoke screen client.

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Kidding, kind of.

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 You might be asking yourself, cool, Kroos, what do you do on the day to day?

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Well, I'd probably have a different response for you depending on the day you ask me.

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 My days can be full of meetings, coming up with briefs which are super fun.

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Taking clients out to fancy lunches to talk to this, to even just working directly with the CEO of the company on a passion project of theirs.

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 And it is super interesting, super dynamic.

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 You can never guess what's going to happen tomorrow.

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 I mean the best you can do is try to set your calendar so that people don't have meetings to do that so that doesn't work.

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 When I think back on my days studying advertising at UT, some of the best aspects was just realizing how broad advertising is.

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 It's not just a typical TV or radio ads.

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 It goes beyond that.

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 The psychology aspect really interested me.

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Everything that encompasses it was so intriguing and it was really really cool.

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And I felt that I was really learning some awesome stuff.

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 I could be taking one course and then the next course you take is completely unrelated.

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 But it doesn't connect until you're at the end of it all.

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And you're like, wow, this is pretty cool.

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 And also it was really cool to do group projects and figure out which one of my group members was brave enough to get sushi from a partner.

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Which I don't know if that's still around.

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I think working and advertising is really cool.

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 It's a pure part of this club of just seeing how things will work on the inside in terms of marketing and all that.

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 When you're on the other side of it, you see all the decisions that go into making it good or bad commercial.

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 And it's kind of cool.

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 It's really cool.

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 I also remember being in pretty much the same shoes a lot of yours right now.

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I could not have imagined what I'm at right now back then.

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 But it just kind of goes to show just how crazy life can be and how much you can grow in life.

00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Something that's really awesome about the industry, you know, is you're going to be a lot of people that have the same mindset.

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 It doesn't matter whether background, they'll have kind of this energy about them.

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And that's really cool.

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 That's something that you kind of start noticing in people.

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 I just kind of wanted to give you a little alumni check-in.

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Who knows?

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Maybe it's going to be you doing this video in a couple of years and putting on your own spin to it.

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 You're all going to have so much fun.

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 It's going to be a crazy little while ride.

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 If you stick with advertising, it's going to be worth it in the end.

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I wish you all the best luck starting out this semester.

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And, you know, if you guys have any questions, if you want to connect through LinkedIn or email,

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 hit up Dr. Chillier's for that information.

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 I'll be more than happy to get back to you all.

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 But most importantly, go Vols.
